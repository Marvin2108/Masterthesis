    "                    A: The sentence “That moment when you have so much stuff to do but you open @tumblr … #productivity #tumblr” can be classified as ironic for several reasons.\n",
    "                    First, the speaker mentions having “so much stuff to do,” which implies a sense of urgency or the need to be productive. This would normally suggest that they should focus on their tasks.\n",
    "                    However, instead of working on these tasks, the speaker states that they opened Tumblr, a platform often associated with leisure, distraction, and procrastination rather than productivity. The speaker juxtaposes the idea of needing to be productive with the act of wasting time on Tumblr, which creates a contradiction between expectations and reality.\n",
    "                    Moreover, the use of hashtags like “#productivity” adds to the irony. By labeling their unproductive behavior as “productivity,” the speaker knowingly highlights the absurdity of their situation. The hashtags suggest that the speaker is aware of the contradiction, further reinforcing the ironic tone.\n",
    "                    In summary, the irony comes from the mismatch between the expectation of being productive and the reality of procrastinating on Tumblr, with the hashtags emphasizing this contrast in a humorous way.\n",
